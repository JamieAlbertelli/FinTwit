Allowed for better functionality:
        
        Migrated from OS to Pathlib as OS package is deprecated.
                Folder Directory now abstracted for users, automatically created.
        Allowed for user input so code can be edited through the CLI instead of manually editing code.
        
        Abstraction has been broken. Simply need to fix variable behaviour.
